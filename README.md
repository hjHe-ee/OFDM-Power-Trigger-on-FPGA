# OFDM-Power-Trigger-on-FPGA
OFDM-Power-Trigger on FPGA provides a robust packet detection scheme by combining power-based triggering with OFDM short preamble auto-correlation. A lightweight FPGA module filters out meaningless signals (e.g., constant power levels) to ensure reliable and accurate preamble detection.The project is derived from the ​​OPENOFDM​​ project.
